# Fixing "Review Issues"

The Review page shows issues that need your attention. Here's how to fix them:

## Types of issues

- **Uncategorized transactions**: Transactions that couldn't be automatically categorized
- **Unknown classification**: Transactions marked as "unknown" (business vs personal)
- **Missing month**: Gaps in your transaction history
- **Missing evidence**: Transactions that should have receipts or documents attached
- **Possible duplicates**: Transactions that appear to be duplicates

## How to fix issues

### Uncategorized transactions

1. Go to Review → Issues
2. Click on an uncategorized transaction
3. Select the correct category
4. Click "Resolve"

### Unknown classification

1. Go to Review → Issues
2. Click on a transaction with unknown classification
3. Mark it as "Business" or "Personal"
4. Click "Resolve"

### Missing evidence

1. Go to Review → Issues
2. Click on a transaction missing evidence
3. Upload the receipt or document
4. Click "Resolve"

### Possible duplicates

1. Go to Review → Issues
2. Review the flagged transactions

4. If they're separate transactions, dismiss the flag

## Tips

- **Fix issues regularly**: Don't let issues pile up. Fix them weekly.
- **Attach receipts**: Attach receipts to business expenses for better record-keeping.
- **Review before filing**: Always review and fix issues before generating filing packs.

## When to ignore issues

Some issues can be safely ignored:
- Personal transactions (if you're not tracking personal expenses)
- Minor categorization issues (if you'll fix them later)
- Duplicate flags for legitimate separate transactions

## Common questions

**Q: Do I need to fix all issues?**
A: Not necessarily. Fix issues that matter for tax compliance. Personal transactions can often be ignored.

**Q: Can I dismiss issues?**
A: Yes, you can dismiss issues that aren't relevant. They won't appear again unless new similar issues arise.

**Q: Will issues affect my filing pack?**
A: Some issues (like missing evidence) are noted in filing packs. Fix critical issues before generating packs.
