# Connecting your bank (read-only)

Connect your bank account to automatically import transactions. Here's how:

## How it works

1. **Choose your bank**: Rorun supports major Nigerian banks through secure providers
2. **Authorize access**: You'll be redirected to your bank's secure login
3. **Grant read-only access**: Rorun requests read-only access (we can't move money)
4. **Automatic sync**: Transactions sync automatically (or manually, depending on your plan)

## Security

- **Read-only**: Rorun can only view transactions and balances. We cannot:
  - Move money
  - Make transactions
  - Change account settings
  - Access your login credentials

- **You control access**: You can revoke bank access anytime in settings

- **Encrypted**: All bank data is encrypted in transit and at rest

## Setting up

1. Go to Settings → Bank Connections
2. Click "Connect Bank"
3. Select your bank
4. Follow the authorization flow
5. Grant read-only access
6. Your bank account will appear in the list

## Managing connections

- **View transactions**: See all transactions from connected accounts
- **Sync manually**: Trigger a manual sync if automatic sync isn't enabled
- **Disconnect**: Remove bank access anytime in settings

## Troubleshooting

**Q: My bank isn't listed**
A: We're adding more banks. For now, use CSV/PDF import instead.

**Q: Connection failed**
A: Make sure you're using the correct bank login credentials. Some banks require additional verification.

**Q: Transactions aren't syncing**
A: Check your plan - automatic sync may require a paid plan. You can always sync manually.

**Q: I want to disconnect**
A: Go to Settings → Bank Connections and click "Disconnect" next to the account.
