# Understanding your obligations dashboard

Your obligations dashboard shows all your tax obligations in one place. Here's how to read it:

## What you'll see

The dashboard shows:
- **CIT (Company Income Tax)**: Your CIT status and obligations
- **VAT (Value Added Tax)**: Your VAT status and obligations
- **WHT (Withholding Tax)**: Your WHT obligations
- **Upcoming deadlines**: Deadlines for filings and payments
- **Status indicators**: Color-coded status (upcoming, due, overdue, fulfilled)

## Understanding statuses

- **Upcoming**: Deadline is in the future
- **Due**: Deadline is approaching (within your reminder threshold)
- **Overdue**: Deadline has passed
- **Fulfilled**: You've completed this obligation

## What to do

1. **Check regularly**: Review your dashboard weekly to stay on top of obligations
2. **Set reminders**: Configure email and SMS reminders in settings
3. **Plan ahead**: Use upcoming deadlines to plan your filing schedule
4. **Mark as fulfilled**: When you complete a filing, mark it as fulfilled (or it will update automatically if you generate a filing pack)

## Common questions

**Q: Why does my dashboard show 0% CIT?**
A: If your turnover is below ₦25 million, you're exempt from CIT but still need to file annually.

**Q: What if I disagree with the obligations shown?**
A: Rorun calculates based on standard rules. If you have a unique situation, consult a tax advisor.

**Q: Can I dismiss obligations?**
A: You can't dismiss obligations, but you can mark them as fulfilled when completed.
