# Importing statements (CSV/Paste/PDF)

You can import bank statements into Rorun in three ways:

## Method 1: CSV upload

1. Export your bank statement as CSV from your bank's portal
2. Go to Transactions → Import
3. Select "Upload CSV"
4. Choose your CSV file
5. Review and confirm the imported transactions

## Method 2: Paste from statement

1. Copy transaction data from your bank statement (text format)
2. Go to Transactions → Import
3. Select "Paste statement"
4. Paste your data
5. Review and confirm the imported transactions

## Method 3: PDF upload

1. Download your bank statement as PDF
2. Go to Transactions → Import
3. Select "Upload PDF"
4. Choose your PDF file
5. Rorun will extract transactions (this may take a moment)
6. Review and confirm the imported transactions

## After importing

- **Review issues**: Check the Review page for any issues with imported transactions
- **Categorize**: Transactions will be auto-categorized, but you can adjust categories manually
- **Fix duplicates**: If you import the same statement twice, duplicates will be flagged

## Tips

- **Format matters**: CSV files should have columns for date, description, amount, and type (credit/debit)
- **Check dates**: Make sure transaction dates are correct after import
- **Review carefully**: Always review imported transactions before confirming

## Troubleshooting

**Q: My CSV import failed**
A: Check that your CSV has the required columns (date, description, amount). Try exporting from your bank again.

**Q: PDF extraction didn't work**
A: Some PDF formats aren't supported. Try exporting as CSV instead.

**Q: I see duplicate transactions**
A: Rorun detects duplicates. You can dismiss duplicate flags if they're legitimate separate transactions.
