# What Rorun does (and what it does not do)

Rorun helps Nigerian SMEs stay tax-compliant and organized. Here's what we do and don't do:

## What Rorun does

- **Calculates your tax obligations**: We determine if you need to pay CIT, VAT, or WHT based on your business profile and turnover.

- **Tracks your transactions**: You can import bank statements, connect your bank account (read-only), or add transactions manually. We help categorize and organize them.

- **Sends reminders**: We notify you before tax deadlines so you don't miss filings.

- **Generates filing packs**: Create year-end filing packs (PDF + CSV) with all your transactions organized for FIRS submission.

- **Provides education**: Learn about Nigerian tax rules in plain English and Pidgin.

## What Rorun does NOT do

- **We are not tax advisors**: Rorun provides tools and information, but we don't give professional tax advice. Consult a qualified accountant or tax advisor for complex situations.

- **We don't file for you**: We generate filing packs, but you (or your accountant) still need to submit them to FIRS.

- **We don't move money**: Bank connections are read-only. We can't make transactions or move money from your account.

- **We don't guarantee accuracy**: While we do our best to calculate correctly, you're responsible for verifying all information before filing.

## When to use Rorun

Rorun is perfect for:
- Small and medium businesses in Nigeria
- Businesses that want to understand their tax obligations
- Businesses that need help organizing transactions
- Businesses that want reminders before deadlines

If you have complex tax situations or need professional advice, consult a qualified accountant or tax advisor.
